							<h3>The Top Five Places To Learn To Dive</h3>
							<p>
								Divers are really astronauts; gliding weightless through the ocean we observe alien worlds carpeted
								in
								vast fields of colourful corals with equally bizarre, enthralling inhabitants - from the foreign
								clicks
								of dolphins communicating to minute technicolour slugs (nudibranch). And best yet, you don't need
								years
								of gruelling training or a rocket to experience these watery worlds, just four days and a
								eagle-ray-eyed
								(sorry) ground control.

							<h3>Dive Into 2019</h3>
							<p>
								As the nights draw in, the temperature drops (we had a good run) and businesses start to compete for
								the
								best Christmas TV ad (move aside Elton, Waitrose's Stollen takes the crown), the festive season is
								upon
								us. So, naturally, we've decided to bypass all of that and look straight ahead to next year, which is
								shaping up to be a good'un. From a very exclusive expedition to the best new openings and
								off-the-beaten
								track diving adventures.

							<h3>Short Haul Winter Diving Destinations</h3>
							<p>
								As we (at least those of us based in Europe) are slowly stepping into the cold of winter and dusting
								off
								our winter clothing, here at Original Diving, we've compiled our list of some top short-haul
								winter-come-spring diving destinations. Here's a selection of places you can get to for a short break
								where the temperature won't chill your bones and the waters remain unfrozen. Enjoy!

							<h3>Beat the System</h3>
							<p>
								Question: do you consider yourself a canny operator (*taps nose and winks*)? Are you willing to buck
								the
								trend, go off-piste, roll the dice as it were? Well it's time to channel your inner wheeler dealer, Ã 
								la
								Del Boy Trotter (perhaps without the dodgy gold medallions and morally ambiguous schemes), and beat
								the
								system, whether travelling out of season.

							<h3>Diving The Galapagos</h3>
							<p>
								This year I turn 30. At the start of the year I decided that it was going to be a big year for me;
								figure out my five year plan, set some challenges, say 'yes' to as much as possible and go on some
								unforgettable trips. The five year plan is still a work in progress, however I did say 'yes' to
								completing a ski marathon so that doubled with a challenge.

					<h1>About Us</h1>
					<p>
						Our approach differs from other travel companies; we are a group of dedicated divers, marine biologists
						and
						travellers who take a creative approach to tailoring luxury diving holidays.
					</p>
					<p>
						We focus on understanding what you want from your holiday, from trips centred entirely around diving to
						holidays with the odd dive included here and there. No matter your level of dive experience and
						knowledge,
						we will tailor the perfect holiday to your requirements using a thoughtful approach, focused on the small
						details that make a big difference.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our aim is to make sure every detail of your holiday is planned to perfection by working with you to hone
						and finesse your itinerary to your exact requirements, from ensuring logistics like transfers and guides
						run like clockwork to giving you access to experiences the average traveller wouldn't find. So you can
						sit
						back, relax and enjoy your Original Diving holiday.
